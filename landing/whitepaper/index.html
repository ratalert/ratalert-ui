              <h2>The Story</h2>
              <img src="../assets/images/image23.png" width="100%" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip">


              <p>
              Paris - it’s the city where aspiring entrepreneurial chefs make their way to the top. Only the crème de la crème will get to <del>open</del> mint their own GourmetFood kitchen such as <em>LeStake©</em>, the famous 3-star restaurant in the metaverse. Slip into the role of an entrepreneurial chef and <del>recruit</del> mint your kitchen team!
              </p>
              <p>
              Of course, you know that expertise requires a lot of practice and so your chefs’ first (staking) position takes them to <em>McStake©</em>, the metaverse’s FastFood joint run by <em>Michael McSaylor</em>. Quickly, their skill level will outgrow the $FFOOD business and they will yearn for more. Knowing that you have already put your earned tokens to good use, your new CasualFood kitchen <em>TheStakeHouse©</em> allows your chefs to produce the delicious $CFOOD. You can already smell the sweet scent of success, when finally, your chefs become the rare elite and produce the low supply $GFOOD in your brand new GourmetFood kitchen <em>LeStake©</em>. At the same time, your chefs are put to the ultimate test. Working at the top means a lot of stress. You will certainly regret it if you let them get burned out or be punished by the food inspector!
              </p>
              <p>
              The three food tokens not only buy you more elaborate kitchens, but also more chefs to scale your endeavour. Or does it…?
              </p>
              <p>
              It does not. You might as well be joined by starving sewer rats that love nothing more than $FFOOD and they will do anything to steal it for you from all over the city. They are quick learners, and you’ll get to make them steal $CFOOD and eventually the fine $GFOOD once their intelligence quotient allows. But beware: Rat traps and cunning cats are all over the place. Don’t let your rats get caught, or suffer the consequences!
              </p>

              <h2>The Mechanics</h2>


              <ul>

              <li>Play to earn different ERC20 tokens by staking your ERC721 characters in one of three available <del>kitchens</del> contracts

              <li>For the first time, you can “train” and “recover” your ERC721 characters through clever staking in different contracts to make them extra valuable

              <li>The rules of the game are entirely on-chain

              <li>Most importantly: Always look after your characters - they are fragile like Tamagotchi!

              <li>The Game is implemented on Polygon (MATIC) for 2 obvious reasons: Gas costs & OpenSea support
              </li>
              </ul>
              <h2>The Venues</h2>

              <h3>FastFood Kitchen <em>McStake©</em></h3>

              <em>Michael McSaylor’s</em> McStake© is “virtually” all over town. Here, chefs start their career as an employee producing $FFOOD which rats love for its “simplicity”.

              There are only a few jobs more stressful than that of a chef. Time is key, language is rough, stakes are high and so is the risk of burnout. Rats on the other hand face the risk of getting overweight and becoming easy prey for cats, especially in FastFood kitchens.
              </p>
              <p>
              Do not let that happen, be sure to send your characters to the gym where they can blow off steam, relax and lose weight.

              Every minted character is unique and has the ability to be trained by the player. Each NFT has 2 attributes that change daily upon unstaking or claiming. Attributes affect the appearance (image) of the NFT, visible both in the game and on OpenSea. The pixel size is 100x100, 3 times the size of other Play2Earn games, like Wolf Game.
              </p>
              <p>
              The mining cost for one Generation 0 NFT is <strong>0.07 WETH</strong>.

              <h3>Chefs</h3>


              <p>
              Chefs are the main character in the game and come with 5 different trait types:
              </p>
              <ul>

              <li>Eyes: includes sunglasses or laser eyes

              <li>Hat: includes various hats, including the famous red cap from McStake©

              <li>Neck: various neck items,like butterfly ties

              <li>Mouth:  includes various beards,like a braided beard

              <li>Hand: includes different accessories, like pastry rollers or knives
              </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
              <strong>90%</strong> of all mints are chefs.
              </p>
              <p>
              Chefs come with two attributes: skill and <strong>insanity</strong>.
              </p>
              <p>
              Chefs earn food tokens depending on what kitchen they are staked into:
              </p>
              <ul>

              <li>250 $FFOOD in the FastFood Kitchen

              <li>25 $CFOOD in the Casual Kitchen

              <li>2.5 $GFOOD in the Gourmet Kitchen
              </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
              <strong>Skill</strong> is an exclusively positive attribute and describes your chef’s ability to learn new things and gain experience. The <strong>skill</strong> level also affects the amount of $xFOOD your chef can produce per day. The smarter your chef gets, the more he will cook.
              </p>
              <p>
              <strong>Insanity </strong>is a two-edged sword: In the beginning, your chef’s insanity attribute is harmless as he just started cooking at the famous McStake© FastFood chain. He’s bored and eager to learn more. Later in his career, your chef starts cooking in his own restaurants and is growing very fond of himself, up to a point where he can simply become <strong>insane.</strong> Being insane comes with a high risk of burnout, effectively ending your chef’s career and returning to square one.
              </p>
              <p>
              However, fortune favors the bold. If you’re keen enough on taking the risk of having your staked chef go insane, you get the chance of minting one of 100 <strong>cats[Link to cat chapter]</strong> for free<strong> </strong>which will deal with rats in its own special way.
              </p>
              <p>
              Even if you’re not able to mint one of the 100 cats, you might still get one by just keeping your chef insane (or the rat obese)
              </p>
              <p>
              The chef’s <strong>skill</strong> level is represented by the <strong>body</strong> while the chef’s <strong>insanity</strong> level is represented by his <strong>head</strong>. Both attributes are displayed on a scale from 0% to 100%.
              </p>

              <p>
              Since your chefs are “collaborating” with the rats, they might be visited by the food inspector. He’ll prohibit your chef from cooking for 24 hours, this results in reduced <strong>skill</strong> and <strong>insanity</strong>.

              <p>
              The more skilled your chef gets, the less likely he is to deal with the food inspector.

              <h5>Burnout event</h5>


              <p>
              Overworking usually leads to exhaustion, fatigue and health problems. Chefs that are <strong>insane </strong>have a very high risk of suffering from burnout. Chefs with a higher skill level are significantly more likely to avoid burnout.
              </p>
              <p>
              Letting your chef work too long while he’s insane bears the risk of him quitting his workplace and re-starting with<strong> 0 skill points</strong> as well as <strong>0 insanity</strong> points.
              </p>
              <p>
              Do not let that happen, be sure to send your Chefs to the Gym to blow off steam and relax.
              </p>

              <h3>Rats</h3>


              <p>
              Rats are the villain characters in the game and can come with 5 different trait types:
              </p>
              <ul>

              <li>Tail: includes tail decorations or injured tails

              <li>Eyes: includes various sunglasses or laser eyes

              <li>Piercings: includes various head piercings, like nose and ear piercings

              <li>Hats:  includes various headgear, including nightcaps or winter hats

              <li>Neck: includes different neck accessories,like ties or scarfs
              </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
              <strong>10%</strong> of all mints are rats.
              </p>
              <p>
              Rats eat and steal <strong>20%</strong> of the Chefs $xFOOD for their rat colony.
              </p>
              <p>
              Rats come with two attributes, <strong>intelligence</strong> and <strong>body mass</strong>.
              </p>
              <p>
              <strong>Intelligence</strong> is an exclusively positive attribute, and describes your rats ability to avoid rat traps from the chef with more confidence.
              </p>
              <p>
              Similar to the chef’s insanity, <strong>body mass </strong>can either be a good or bad attribute: Rats start as <strong>anorexic </strong>and need to gain body mass in order to eat and steal more $xFOOD for their colony. After some time, they’ll become <strong>athletic, </strong>which is the most perfect state for a rat. Athletic rats can steal the optimum of $xFOOD per day from the Chefs. Rats that are thinner or heavier than <strong>athletic, </strong>are not as efficient when it comes to stealing from the chefs.
              </p>
              <p>
              Rats that are getting fat have several disadvantages: they are more sluggish and weak than their thinner fellow rats, thus they’re able to carry less food when staked into a kitchen. Obese rats have one distinct disadvantage. They are an easy target for the Chef’s cat. Cats really love obese rats and won’t hesitate to kidnap them when they spot them. <strong>A kidnapped rat will re-start with 0 intelligence points and 0 body mass points.</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
              As long as you have at least one obese rat staked and own at least one chef, you will be able to randomly receive one of the minted <strong>cats[Link to cat chapter], </strong>enabling you to use it to your advantage.
              </p>
              <p>
              The rat's <strong>intelligence</strong> level is represented by the <strong>head</strong> while the <strong>body mass</strong> level is represented by the <strong>body</strong>.
              </p>
              <p>
              Both attributes are displayed on a scale from 0 to 100%.
              </p>

              <p>
              Not all chefs like the fact that there has been a deal to give away 20% of all food produced, so some of them set up rat traps. Getting stuck in a trap is very stressful for rats so they’re losing both <strong>body mass</strong> and <strong>intelligence</strong> points while being trapped. Smarter rats are able to avoid rat traps more often.

              <h5>Being caught by a cat event</h5>


              <p>
              Overweight and obese rats are very sluggish and weak. They move very slowly and it’s hard for them to avoid their natural enemies - cats. Cats really love obese rats because they’re an easy target. Smarter rats have a lower chance of getting spotted by cats.
              </p>
              <p>
              An obese rat caught by a cat suffers from total loss of <strong>intelligence</strong> and <strong>body mass</strong>.
              </p>
              <p>
              Do not let that happen, be sure to send your rats to the Gym where they can lose some fat!
              </p>
              <p>
              Events occur when you claim or unstake your rats.

              <h3>Cats</h3>


              <p>
              The third playable character is the cat. There are only 100 cats in the game and they can be minted for free only by insane chefs. A cat allows you to steal the loot from 5 random obese rats per day. After 10 days, the cat will seek a new home either at another random insane chef owner or to an obese rat owner with at least one chef (the insanity level of the ‘add-on chef’ does not matter in this case).
              </p>
              <p>
              The cat is designed to be the risk reward when playing bold by staking:
              </p>
              <ul>

              <li><strong>insane chefs</strong> that can randomly suffer from burnout

              <li><strong>obese rats</strong> that can be randomly killed by a cat
              </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
              There are no events, attributes or traits for cats.
